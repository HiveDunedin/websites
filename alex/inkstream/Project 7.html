    So, what is Project 7? Project 7 is an animated series that TheSketchFox came up with the idea for.
    <br>So, if you have a long enough attention span, I will tell you about the basic plot Project 7, since you probably have no clue what it is about. Project 7 is set in another world, like Narnia (from The Lion, The Witch and The Waldrobe). There is someone called The Creator, who rules over everyone. He is basically a god. He creates three sparks (what makes up people in their world) and places them into three different people, called Cris, Connor and Dominic. But, there was also a clan that attacked them! (name not yet chosen). They had to fight them off all the time.
    <br>One day, the Creator accidentaly kills them by taking away their possesions. Then their sparks are split, half goes into three new characters called Lily, Andrew and James.
    <br>And that is where the story ends today! Guys! Oh, come on! You're already asleep?
    <br><br> Currently, no episodes have been released, as it is still in development. Come back in about ten years time!
    <br>Meanwhile, tell us what you think, and any suggestions you have for it in the comments section.
