            <p class="right">Whenever I get a package of plain M&amp;Ms, I make it my duty to continue the strength and robustness of the candy as a species. To this end, I hold M&amp;M duels. Taking two candies between my thumb and forefinger, I apply pressure, squeezing them together until one of them cracks and splinters. That is the "loser," and I eat the inferior one immediately. The winner gets to go another round. I have found that, in general, the brown and red M&amp;Ms are tougher, and the newer blue ones are genetically inferior. I have hypothesized that the blue M&amp;Ms as a race cannot survive long in the intense theatre of competition that is the modern candy and snack-food world.</p>
            <p>Occasionally I will get a mutation, a candy that is misshapen, or pointier, or flatter than the rest. Almost invariably this proves to be a weakness, but on very rare occasions it gives the candy extra strength In this way, the species continues to adapt to its environment.</p>
            <p>When I reach the end of the pack, I am left with one M&amp;M, the strongest of the herd. Since it would make no sense to eat this one as well, I pack it neatly in an envelope and send it to:</p>
            <p>M&amp;M Mars, A Division of Mars, Inc. Hackettstown, NJ 17840-1503 U.S.A.</p>
            <p>along with a 3x5 card reading, "Please use this M&amp;M for breeding purposes."</p>
            <p>This week they wrote back to thank me, and sent me a coupon for a free 1/2 pound bag of plain M&amp;Ms. I consider this "grant money." I have set aside the weekend for a grand tournament. From a field of hundreds, we will discover the True Champion.</p>
            <p>There can be only one!</p>
